## Get Started

### Prerequisites

To able to run this project you will need Node.js installed on your computer.

### Installation

<!-- Open your command line of your IDE and change directory to "backend" and install below: -->

Install the requirements for the "backend" folder below:

```sh
npm install express
npm install body-parser
npm install bcryptjs
npm install express-validator
npm install multer
npm install uuid
npm install jsonwebtoken
npm install mongoose
```

Install the requirements for the "frontend" folder below:

```sh
npm install react react-dom
npm install react-redux
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit
npm install react-router-dom
```

After installing all the requirements, you need a MongoDB API KEY to access the database.

Enter your key in `app.js` on the backend folder.

```js
const API_KEY = "enter_api_key";
```

## Usage

You can start the both servers -backend & frontend- via

npm start
```

Finally, you must have both servers up and running to app work.
